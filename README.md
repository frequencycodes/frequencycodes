### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Aaron! Welcome to my GitHub. I am a freelance writer and front end developer. 
My current projects include a Medium clone and a self publishing novel integration platform.
I am currently learning back end development after realizing I dislike client side environments.
I am always looking for new people to meet and share ideas with, so feel free to reach out if you feel inclined :)
