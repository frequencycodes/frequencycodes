### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Aaron! Welcome to my GitHub.

I am a writer & editor, photographer, filmmaker, and dog dad currently teaching myself how to code so I can one day become a full time Dev! Making a career change is scary and never easy, but I am determined to prove to someone else in my shoes that it is possible even in your 30's.

Follow me on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frequencycodes/">Instagram</a> where I will be documenting my "100 Days of Code" journey as well as posting pictures of my work-from-home desk set up and little bits of my life. Feel free to reach out and say hey!

This is my boy Moose! aka Jedi Master, aka Sausage, aka Larry, aka Sleepy Boi.
